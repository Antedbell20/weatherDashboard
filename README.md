## Description 
This is an application that can give you the 5 day weather forecast for any city of your choosing. It pulls the weather info from an API and displays on the page. It will tell you the day, temp, humidity, wind speed, and UV index. The UV index is color coded based off of if it is a dangerous index or not.
